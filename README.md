# RGB-App

RGBApp is a react native app that I use to to control my home made RGB smart light. This app works by sending requests to my light containing RGB values. I built the light from a 5 meter RGB strip which is controlled by an ESP8266 running a simple web server. This app consists of 6 sliders allowing the user to fine tune which exact colour they would like to select. The first three sliders directly control RGB values, followed by the last three sliders which control HSL values.
